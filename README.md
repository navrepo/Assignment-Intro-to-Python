Intro to Python - Homework Assignment: Lessons 1-2
Variables, Input/Output & Control Flow
Important Instructions:
Create a Python file in VS Code for each question (e.g., question1.py, question2.py, etc.)
Test each program to make sure it works correctly
Save all your Python files in a folder called "homework"
Upload the work to github and submit the link to the repository

Question 1: Movie Ticket Pricing (Lesson 1 - Variables & Output)
Points: 8
Write a Python program that calculates movie ticket costs with different pricing.
Requirements:
Ask the user for their name and age
Set ticket prices: 
Child (under 13): $8
Adult(13âˆ’64):$12
Senior (65+): $9
Ask how many tickets they want (Ticket prices should be calculated based on the age of the person buying them)
Calculate total cost and display a receipt-style output
Use f-string formatting for the receipt
Create file: question1.py
Example Output:
Enter your name: Sarah
Enter your age: 28
How many tickets do you want? 2

=== MOVIE TICKET RECEIPT ===
Customer: Sarah
Ticket Type: Adult ($12.00 each)
Quantity: 2
Total Cost: $24.00
Thank you for your purchase!

Question 2: Restaurant Order System (Lesson 2 - If/Elif/Else)
Points: 10
Create a program that takes a restaurant order and calculates the bill based on menu choices.
Requirements:
Display a menu with 4 food options and prices:
Pizza - $15.99
Burger - $12.50
Salad - $9.99
Pasta - $13.75
Ask user to choose by number (1-4)
Ask if they want a drink (+$2.50)
Calculate total with 8% tax
Display itemized bill
Create file: question2.py
Example Output:
=== RESTAURANT MENU ===
1. Pizza - $15.99
2. Burger - $12.50
3. Salad - $9.99
4. Pasta - $13.75

Enter your choice (1-4): 1
Would you like a drink? (+$2.50) (yes/no): yes

=== YOUR ORDER ===
Food: Pizza - $15.99
Drink: Yes - $2.50
Subtotal: $18.49
Tax (8%): $1.48
Total: $19.97

Question 3: Pet Age Calculator (Lessons 1-2 Combined)
Points: 12
Create a program that converts human years to pet years for different animals.
Requirements:
Ask for pet type (dog, cat, bird, hamster)
Ask for pet's age in human years
Convert using these formulas:
Dog: First 2 years = 24 pet years, then 4 years for each additional year
Cat: First 2 years = 24 pet years, then 4 years for each additional year
Bird: Multiply by 9
Hamster: Multiply by 25
Display the converted age with a fun message
Create file: question3.py
Example Output:
Enter pet type (dog/cat/bird/hamster): dog
Enter your pet's age in human years: 5

=== PET AGE CONVERSION ===
Pet Type: Dog
Human Age: 5 years
Pet Age: 36 pet years

Fun Fact: Your dog is like a 36-year-old human!

Enter pet type (dog/cat/bird/hamster): hamster
Enter your pet's age in human years: 2
=== PET AGE CONVERSION ===
Pet Type: Hamster
Human Age: 2 years
Pet Age: 50 pet years

Fun Fact: Your hamster is like a 50-year-old human!
